# ⚖️ Skill College – Quality & Accountability Policy

> “Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.” – Henry Ford

---

## 🚀 Why We Are Implementing This Policy

At Skill College, we are building a disruptive education platform that has the power to transform learning worldwide. To achieve this, we must ensure zero-compromise on quality.

This policy is designed to:

* Reduce production bugs
* Increase ownership & responsibility
* Create a culture of excellence and continuous growth

---

## 🔑 Principles Behind the Policy

* Accountability drives excellence
* Collaboration reduces errors
* Every bug is a learning opportunity

> “Mistakes are proof that you are trying — but repeated mistakes show lack of responsibility.”

## 🛠️ Bug Severity Levels & Penalties

| Level                      | Examples                                        | Penalty | Liable                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Critical (High Impact)** | Data loss, payment failure, crash, login issues | ₹3,000  | Developer + Manager               |
| **Major (Medium Impact)**  | Wrong calc, broken features, security warnings  | ₹2,000  | Manager (Developer if negligence) |
| **Minor (Low Impact)**     | Typos, small UI mismatch, console warnings      | ₹1,000  | Manager (Developer if careless)   |

---

## 👥 Who Decides Liability?

The **CTO** will decide which team (Backend, Frontend, or Mobile) and which individuals (Developer, Manager, or both) are liable for each bug.

> “Responsibility is shared, but accountability is owned.”

---

## 📌 Accountability Rules

* **Developer Responsibility**: Must disclose known issues, must test thoroughly.
* **Manager Responsibility**: Ensure review & testing before approval, cover missing scenarios.
* **New/Unknown Scenarios**: If unpredictable → No penalties.

---

## 🎁 Bug Finder Rewards (Optional)

At times, **non-development team members** (QA, Product, Support, or even other staff) may identify bugs before customers face them.

* In such cases, Skill College **may provide a token reward** to acknowledge their contribution.
* This is **not guaranteed** and will be at management’s discretion.
* Rewards can be in the form of vouchers, recognition, or small monetary bonuses.

> “Finding a bug early saves a hundred users from frustration — and that’s worth celebrating.”

---

## 🌱 Motivation & Growth

While penalties ensure discipline, we also encourage growth:

* Every bug will be discussed in retrospectives.
* Learning points shared across teams.
* 3 months bug-free → rewarded & recognized.

> “Discipline is the bridge between goals and achievement.”

---

## 🌟 Final Note

At Skill College, we are not just building software — we are creating a future-ready education system. This policy ensures that every line of code matters and that accountability leads to excellence.

> “Excellence is not an act, but a habit.”
